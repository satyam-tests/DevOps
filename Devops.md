- DevOps is the process of Continious Integration and Continious Delivery.
- Where Devlopment comes under Continious Integration and Operations come under Continious Delivery.

While the Application is live you have to operate and monitor it.
1. Any Problem arises
2. Any user experience issue
3. High user load
4. Improve features, fix bugs, optimize it.

**Note: Changes are always versioned**

### Continious Delivery
It is the process of endless cycle of improvements.

**DevOps**: It is the process of making the continious Delivery Fast with minimal bugs.

### Challenges Solved by DevOps
  1. Fictions and Roadbocks
  2. Conflict of Interest
  3. Security issues
  4. Application testing
  5. Manual Work
 
#### Fictions and Roadblocks
  - Miscommunications and lack of collaboration with operations team and Developers team.
  - Developers code the application while operations do not know how the app works.
  - Developers do not consider where the app gets deployed
  - No proper deployment guide from Development team
  - Due to lack of guide operations team take long to release the application.

#### Conflict of Interest

  - Both have different incentives
    - Developers want new features fast while operations have to maintain stability.
  - Developers are not aware of the challenges that operations teams have to face and they want quick improvements and updating quickly but operations need proper testing and time.

#### Secutity issues
  - Will it affect the systems stability.
  - will it affect the systems security.
  - Here comes another domain which is **DEV-SEC-OPS**
  - DevSecOps highlights the importance of security.

#### Application Testing
  Testing the apps on different levels
  - features
  - End to End effects
  - Testing on different environments
  - Performance tests

#### Manual
  - Some tasks like 
    - Testing
    - Security checks
    - Deployment

  -
